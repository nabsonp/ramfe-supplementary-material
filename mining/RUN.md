# Collection run — 24 September 2026

One execution of [`collect_repositories.py`](collect_repositories.py) over the full window, following [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md). This is the run whose output feeds the manual assessment.

## What came out

| stage | repositories |
|---|---|
| collected, deduplicated | **20,099** |
| layer 1 — fork, template, empty, no language | −2,684 |
| layer 2 — example, POC, boilerplate, another "micro" | −2,249 |
| layer 3 — EC5, abandoned on creation | −13,036 |
| layer 4 — EC6, too small to be a unit | −223 |
| **for manual assessment** | **1,907** |

By criterion, since one layer can serve more than one:

| criterion | discarded |
|---|---|
| EC5 · abandoned on creation | 13,036 |
| EC1 · not a software implementation | 2,553 |
| EC2 / EC3 · example, POC, boilerplate | 1,845 |
| EC1 · another "micro" domain | 404 |
| EC6 · too small to be a unit | 223 |
| EC3 · template flagged by the owner | 131 |

**EC5 alone discarded 65% of the collection.** Two thirds of everything the search returns was created and abandoned without anyone coming back, which confirms across the whole corpus what the two-month pilot had shown.

The terms that fired in layer 2, in order: `example` 1,061 · `poc` 740 · `boilerplate` 156 · `examples` 84 · `proof of concept` 65 · `tutorial` 64 · `exemplo` 38 · `proof-of-concept` 11. The four hyphen-and-space variants of *proof of concept* between them caught 76 repositories that the single spelling would have missed.

## When these repositories were created

| year | repositories |
|---|---|
| 2013–2017 | 54 |
| 2018 | 213 |
| 2019 | 688 |
| 2020 | 1,385 |
| 2021 | 2,530 |
| 2022 | 2,948 |
| 2023 | 2,917 |
| 2024 | 3,114 |
| 2025 | 3,636 |
| 2026 (until September) | 2,614 |

The curve matches the term's history: "micro frontends" was coined in the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar in November 2016, and the volume leaves the dozens for the thousands from 2019 on. The 54 repositories predating 2018 are worth treating with suspicion — in the pilot, every pre-2014 hit turned out to be an accidental match on the words rather than the subject.

## The population that survived

Of the 1,907 left for assessment:

| | median | p90 | max |
|---|---|---|---|
| commits | 42 | 232 | 17,620 |
| lifespan, days | 83 | 1,208 | 4,250 |
| source files | 41 | 181 | 5,046 |
| `package.json` files | 4 | 10 | 213 |
| stars | 0 | 11 | 18,489 |

| | count |
|---|---|
| with at least one star | 701 |
| with an issue or a pull request | 1,087 |
| with a release | 229 |
| archived | 74 |
| with two or more `package.json` | 1,391 |

TypeScript leads at 879, JavaScript follows at 832; then HTML 54, Vue 50, CSS 20, Java 18.

The median star count is **zero**, which is the population this study wants and the reason every popularity signal was rejected as a criterion: over half of what survived would have been cut by any of them.

## Multi-repository systems

`--siblings` listed **12,801 repositories across 251 organisations**. Personal accounts are not listed: in the pilot, 21 of them held 615 repositories for the 23 that had matched, and grouping the rest buys nothing.

**31 organisations have two or more repositories that matched the search**, which is the strongest available hint of a system split across repositories. They are where the grouping work starts.

The list is not meant to be read end to end. It exists so that, when a candidate looks like part of something larger, its siblings can be found — including the ones that never matched the search, which is the whole point: a repository named `mfe-checkout` may never write "micro frontend" anywhere.

## Files

| file | rows | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `raw.csv` | 20,099 | everything, excluded rows included, with the criterion and the term that fired |
| `screened.csv` | 1,907 | survivors, with blank columns for the manual assessment |
| `siblings.csv` | 12,801 | every repository of each surviving organisation |
| `summary.txt` | — | counts at each stage |

Nothing was deleted: a repository excluded automatically is a marked row in `raw.csv`, so one dropped by mistake stays recoverable.

## What this run does not settle

**The thresholds are still provisional.** EC5 at 20 commits and EC6 at 10 source files were fixed against a two-month pilot, by judging by eye which repositories looked like real systems. They are defensible, not proven, and nothing in the current design checks them against ground truth.

**IC2 has not been touched.** Whether a repository is part of a micro frontend system, and not a library, is a judgement call with no automatic rule; the column is blank on purpose.

**1,907 is still a lot.** If the assessment confirms the thresholds, step 4 of the protocol applies: compute a sample size and draw systems at random, or walk the list in a random order and stop at the number of real systems the study needs.
